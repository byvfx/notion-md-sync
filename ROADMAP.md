# Notion Markdown Sync - Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plans for the Notion Markdown Sync tool. Our goal is to create a robust, feature-rich tool that enables seamless bidirectional syncing between local markdown files and Notion, while supporting Git version control.

## 1. Bidirectional Sync Improvements

- [ ] Complete notion-to-markdown sync functionality
- [ ] Implement robust conflict detection with visual diff
- [ ] Add multiple conflict resolution strategies:
  - [ ] Newest wins (timestamp-based)
  - [ ] Interactive resolution UI
  - [ ] Source-specific prioritization (markdown wins, Notion wins)
- [ ] Track sync status with proper checksums and timestamps

## 2. Enhanced Content Support

- [ ] Image handling and syncing
  - [ ] Local image path resolution
  - [ ] Automatic upload to Notion
  - [ ] Download Notion images to local path
- [ ] Support for embedded content
  - [ ] Videos
  - [ ] PDFs
  - [ ] Other file types
- [ ] Advanced Notion block types
  - [ ] Toggles
  - [ ] Callouts
  - [ ] Equations (LaTeX)
  - [ ] Dividers
  - [ ] Table of contents
- [ ] Table support with proper formatting in both directions
- [ ] Support for Notion comments

## 3. User Experience

- [ ] Web UI for visual conflict resolution
- [ ] GUI application wrapper
  - [ ] Desktop application (Electron or similar)
  - [ ] System tray integration
- [ ] Visual notifications for sync status
- [ ] Integration with desktop editors or IDEs
  - [ ] VS Code extension
  - [ ] JetBrains plugin
- [ ] Improved CLI with interactive prompts and color output

## 4. Git Integration

- [ ] Automatic sync on git commit hooks
- [ ] GitHub Actions integration for automatic syncing
- [ ] Branch-based syncing (different branches could sync to different Notion workspaces)
- [ ] Ignore pattern syncing with .gitignore
- [ ] PR/commit messages synced as Notion comments
- [ ] Embedded git metadata in Notion pages

## 5. Performance & Reliability

- [ ] Batch processing for large document sets
- [ ] Incremental syncing (only changed blocks)
- [ ] Retry logic and better error handling
- [ ] Sync queue for handling large batches
- [ ] Parallel processing for multiple files
- [ ] Rate limiting management for Notion API
- [ ] Offline mode with queued changes

## 6. Metadata & Organization

- [ ] Tag-based organization in both Notion and local files
- [ ] Folder structure mirroring between local and Notion
- [ ] Better support for Notion databases with properties
- [ ] Custom frontmatter templates for different document types
- [ ] Handling of nested pages/subpages
- [ ] Customizable naming conventions and path mapping

## 7. Security & Access Control

- [ ] Multi-user support with different Notion tokens
- [ ] Read-only mode for certain paths
- [ ] Encryption for sensitive content
- [ ] Access logs and audit trail
- [ ] Selective sync (include/exclude patterns)
- [ ] Sensitive information filtering

## 8. Advanced Features

- [ ] Support for Notion templates
- [ ] Backup and restore functionality
- [ ] Search across local markdown files
- [ ] Markdown linting and formatting
- [ ] Content versioning beyond git
- [ ] Scheduling and automated sync intervals

- [ ] Package for popular package managers (pip, homebrew, etc.)
- [ ] Cloud-hosted version with subscription model
- [ ] One-click installer for non-technical users
- [ ] Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## 10. Documentation & Community

- [ ] Comprehensive user documentation
- [ ] API documentation for extensibility
- [ ] Examples and templates
- [ ] Community contributions and plugin system
- [ ] Interactive tutorials
- [ ] Video walkthroughs of features
- [ ] Community forum or discussion space
